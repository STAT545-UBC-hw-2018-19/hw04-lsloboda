# Using dplyr, ggplot2 to explore data

## Initialize the data

* Load the gapminder, tidyverse and knitr libraries:

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(tidyverse))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(gapminder))
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(knitr))
```


* The knitr library is useful for improving the appearance of tables using the kable() command, described in more detail [here](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/knitr/versions/1.20/topics/kable).
* We will take a quick look at the data to *sanity check* that the data and variables appear as we expect:

```{r}
(head(gapminder))
```

* Everything looks as expected, so let's start exploring the data

## Task 1
*Get the max and min GDP per capita for all continents.*

### Method
* Reduce the data subset using select and group_by
* Find the minimum and maximum values
